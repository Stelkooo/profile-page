        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring front end web developer who loves to code even if I am still fairly new to it all.</p>
        <p>Currently I am 1st/2nd Line IT Support with a bit of 3rd Line person who enjoys automating anything at work with PowerShell.</p>
        <p>I love to constantly learn new things and skills as otherwise life will be boring.</p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li><img src="images/html.png" height="50px"></li>
          <li><img src="images/css.png" height="50px"></li>
          <li><img src="images/js.png" height="50px"></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would like to work for a web design firm helping clients create their visions.</p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to bike around my city either it be by a road bike and going through the streets as fast as possible,
          going through trails with a mountain bike or just flowing with a BMX. It is just quite peaceful when you have
           earphones in and just exploring the city.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy wathcing F1 with my favourite team being Red Bull since as a brand they do a lot of
           crazy things. As I love watching racing I also like going go karting from time to time with my mates.
        </p>
        <p>Playing video games is a big part of my life since I do that a lot with thousands of hours poured into games.
           Mostly FPS games such as Rainbow Six Siege, which I was a semi-pro at, but also chilled out games like Minecraft,
            but with tech and magic mods.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
        <p>My current experience with web dev is mostly just HTML and CSS with the tiniest bit of JS.</p>
        <p>I have mostly used HTML and CSS in my workplace for sending out emails to my team about the current
           status of our IT equipment.
        </p>
        <p>I learned a lot of Python and Java in college but I took a preference to Java which I managed to get 
          really far in. However, nowadays it is mostly just PowerShell and Batch.
