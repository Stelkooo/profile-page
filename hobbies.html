            <h2>Biking</h2>
            <p>I love to bike around my city either it be by a road bike and going through the streets as fast as possible,
              going through trails with a mountain bike or just flowing with a BMX. It is just quite peaceful when you have
               earphones in and just exploring the city.</p>

            <h2>Racing</h2>
            <p>I also enjoy wathcing F1 with my favourite team being Red Bull since as a brand they do a lot of
               crazy things. As I love watching racing I also like going go karting from time to time with my mates.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Playing video games is a big part of my life since I do that a lot with thousands of hours poured into games.
               Mostly FPS games such as Rainbow Six Siege, which I was a semi-pro at, but also chilled out games like Minecraft,
                but with tech and magic mods.
